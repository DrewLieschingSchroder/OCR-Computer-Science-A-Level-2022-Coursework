This is the latest version of my project report and code I had on my computer (final version was completed in at school, no longer have access).

This is the first time uploading to GitHub, so hopefully everything was uploaded correctly.

The coursework is an educational game, coded in C++ using the library SFML.

Resources used: w3schools.com, geekforgeeks.com, SonarSystems Youtube (learned about state machine + SFML)
