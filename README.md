This is the latest version of my project report and code I had on my computer.

This is the first time uploading to GitHub, so hopefully everything was uploaded correctly.

The coursework is an educational game, coded in C++ using the library SFML.

Resources used: w3schools.com, geekforgeeks.com, SonarSystems Youtube (learned about state machine + SFML)
